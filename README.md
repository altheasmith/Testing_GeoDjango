# Testing_GeoDjango
A Django project roughly following the [GeoDjango Tutorial](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.8/ref/contrib/gis/tutorial/) to model world borders, built on a Vagrant Ubuntu/trusty64 virtual box.

Installation.md includes the instructions I followed for setting up the environment to run through the tutorial. Adapted from [vmenezes](https://github.com/vmenezes)
